# Html2haml [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/haml/html2haml.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/haml/html2haml)

Converts HTML to Haml.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'html2haml'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install html2haml

## Usage

### To convert a project from .erb to .haml

If your system has `sed` and `xargs` available and none of your .erb file names have whitespace in them, you
can convert all your templates like so:

    find . -name \*.erb -print | sed 'p;s/.erb$/.haml/' | xargs -n2 html2haml

If some of your file names have whitespace or you need finer-grained control over the process,
you can convert your files using `gsed` or multi-line script techniques discussed
[here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17576814/).
